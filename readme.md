<h1 align="center">QCalculator</h1>

<h2 align="center">This is my first project written in C++ Qt.</h2>

## Build

```
qmake xxx.pro
make
./calculator
```

## I'm a noobe
I copied most code from a YouTube video, But the code I copied didn't works well, so I changed some. And I also added some new features.

As a Apple fan without any Mac, I copied the macOS calculator UI. But it's still very ugly.

## PR and issues are welcome

This project is use for learning Qt, in this case it's very useful and "not terrible" (不是

If you are a dalao, why don't help me make the calculator works better. Thanks.
